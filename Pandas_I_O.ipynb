Alignment is done on\n","    Series/DataFrame inputs.\n","\n","    If data is a list of dicts, column order follows insertion-order.\n","\n","index : Index or array-like\n","    Index to use for resulting frame.

For DataFrame\n","    or 2d ndarray input, the default of None behaves like ``copy=False``.\n","    If data is a dict containing one or more Series (possibly of different dtypes),\n","
